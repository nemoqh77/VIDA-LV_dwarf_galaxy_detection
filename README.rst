VIDA(LV_dwarf_galaxy_detection)
-----------

Local Volume dwarf galaxy detection and classification base on CSST simulation data & ViT model



Installation
----------------

Before installation, make sure you have pytorch or install essential dependencies :

.. code::

  pip install -r requirements.txt



* Installation

.. code::

  pip install --user -e.


Download the ViT model "vit-base-patch16-224-in21k"
----------------

https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit


Getting started 
----------------

.. code::

  cd examples

dg_detection.ipynb:  algorithm of extended sources detection.

ViT_result.ipynb:  load ViT training result.



Train model with dataset Group A and B:
----------------
.. code::

  python3 ViT_train.py 1 1 0.00005 
 
The first "1" means run train GroupA , second "1" means run train GroupB (if don't train the GroupA or B, change "1" to "0")

0.00005: learning rate


Test model with dataset Group A and B:
----------------
.. code::

  python3 ViT_test.py 1 1 0.00005 ep1 ep2
 
The first "1" means run train GroupA , second "1" means run train GroupB (if don't train the GroupA or B, change "1" to "0")

0.00005: learning rate

ep1 and ep2 represent the epoch range (0-60) you selected for model testing to obtain prediction results. 

data example
----------------
data: simulation image data of CSST

dataset: a group of A/B dataset samples of ViT model.
